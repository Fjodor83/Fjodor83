- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fjodor83
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, full-stack web development, and enterprise applications, with a strong focus on C#/.NET, clean architecture, and scalable systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced ASP.NET Core (.NET 9), software architecture patterns (Service & Repository, Clean Architecture), testing strategies, and modern frontend integrations with Tailwind CSS, React, and TypeScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack web applications, ASP.NET MVC / Web API projects, enterprise systems, and open-source projects related to food delivery, logistics, and supply chain management.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub messages or via my professional network (LinkedIn/email, if shared).
